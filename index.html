    <p>Hydrangea</p>

    <h4>What Am I</h4>
    <p>Hydrangea, commonly named the hortensia, is a genus of more than 70 species of flowering plants native to Asia
        and the Americas. By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China, Korea, and Japan.
    </p>

    <h4>Life Cycle</h4>
    <p>Hydrangea flowers are produced from early spring to late autumn; they grow in flowerheads (corymbs or panicles)
        most often at the ends of the stems.
    </p>

    <h4>Colors</h4>
    <p>Hydrangea flower color can change based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH" target="_blank">pH</a>
        in soil.
        Soil with a pH of 5.5 or lower will produce blue flowers,
        a pH of 6.5 or higher will produce pink hydrangeas, and soil in between 5.5 and 6.5 will have purple hydrangeas.
        White hydrangeas cannot be color-manipulated by soil pH because they do not produce pigment for color.
